# China's-Intellectual-Properties-Protection
<p>I will  say that China's copyright laws are good, as they are similar to our copyright laws. I think the idea of a copyright lasting longer than the author's life is good, because it makes sure to protect that author's work for a long time.</p>

I could understand how people wouldn't like this however, as it does last an incredibly long time. A solution to that problem would be to lower the 50 years after death to maybe 25 years.
